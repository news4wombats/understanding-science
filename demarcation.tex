What distinguishes science from non-science?

To consider a specific  example--- It seems natural to say that big bang cosmology is a scientific theory, and that the biblical account in Genesis according to which God created the universe in seven days is a non-scientific or unscientific account.

This is the problem of \emph{demarcation}.

It is made more pressing because of the problem of pseudo-science. Some champions of the biblical account have been unhappy to accept it as unscientific. They have tried to retell the story so that it would count as a scientific theory. This approach has, over the years, been called ``scientific creationism'' or ``intelligent design theory''. Whether they succeed depends in part on what is required in order for something to be scientific--- that is, it presumes a solution to the problem of demarcation.
